<block2>The truth about our Prison</block2>
<block1>Keywords: Freedom = "free" of "dome" // People: humans with empathy // Slavers: psycopaths, creatures of control</block1>
<block1>The Earth is flat. "Gravity" is a fiction. We are sourended by water from all sides. These water walls are manipulated by magnetism. At the middle of this cage there is a hole up and down. 
  This is a prison and most likely a tool to entertain, study, execute experiments.
  <br> The only thing people are not limited to do (by our own biology) is reprodaction. 
  It is the most developed part of us. Sex gives us the most of chemical rewards for our body with the least amount of backdraws. 
  This might suggest that we were made to be many for their pleausre. Otherwise they would risk depopulation. 
  What suggests that they already know we will not want to exist in this system.

Supply systems to keep us "a-live":  <br>- freshwater: source of rivers are just tubes from down. <br>- saltwater: tide as the alternate rising and falling of 
  the sea which is a system of under water tubes that change the salt water in oceans. Tide has nothing to do with the Moon. <br>- basic elements: 
  volcanos are just different type of tubes to push minerals into the system. 
 <br>Control systems: - animals: in simple times we were controled and discarriged from certain things or areas by predators. 
  Polar bears and bears were created to protect the "north hole". The origin of bears are all from the "north".
 <br>-saltwater: oceans should prevent us to leave a continent.
 <br>-weather: people can live without cloths or shelter in an extremly limited area. Our body cannot handle drastic weather changes.

  <block1>We are surrounded by psychopaths. These control everything from a family level to a worldwide. The only true humans are the ones who have empathy.
<br><br>This is our "almost" real map (there is a missing continent and lots of islands):<br>

<block1>There is oil everywhere. It is a layer under the dirt, rocks, water and minerals. 
The deepest place before the underground barrier is apromoxetly 9 miles. The highest is 33 miles above the ocean level.</block1>
<block1>Budapest will be destroyed between 2022-2033. All DC movies have lines or pictures about Budapest since 2008, it is part of the preprograming.

<block1> Those who are on the other side of this water based closed system are pure evil. And what "evil" means in this case: creating pain and/or 
  suffering on humans while not doing anything to prevent it. We are all alone in here. There is no outside help for us. 
  <block1>Our only hope is to be completely destroyed. The only way I see our escape that
  a 3rd force destroyes our creators and with that probably we will perish too. <br>But to not "be" is still better than constant suffering for an eternity.</block1>
